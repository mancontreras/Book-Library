# Library

Libraries are getting increasingly rare, and many of them have failed to keep up with an inventory of all the materials they can offer. This can lead to a problem in organization as they don´t know which materials are still there, and which materials are gone, lost, borrowed, etc.
Also in these cases, accesing the important information of each piece of material can be difficult because they don´t have a database with all of it. 
The problem I will solve is the absence of a good way of keeping track of the inventory of books in a library and see the information of each piece of material that a library can offer. Also I will add functions so the user can see the important information por each piece of material. 
I will keep track of how many materials are available, as well as all the important information for each one. 
The administrator will be able to add new materials and change the information (if it can be changed).
I think this is interesting because it is a very flexible problem and can have a lot of classes put into it. Also because libraries are becoming increasingly rare. 
I will create specific classes for different types of materials that could be borrowed from a library. All of them will inherit certain attributes from class: Material.
For composition, I will focus on specific characteristics for ach type of material in order to create classes that contain more specific parts of each material. For example: articles that belong to a magazine.
