# Library
The problem I will solve is the absence of a good way of keeping track of the inventory of books in a library.
I will keep track of how many books are available, how many are in loan, books that are in bad shape.
The administrator will be able to add new books, change books between classes,etc. 
Also I will keep track of the people that have books and I will be able to sort them into classes. Loans on time, late loans, stutdents that mistreated books etc.
I think this is interesting because it is a very flexible problem and can have a lot of classes put into it. Also because libraries are becoming increasingly rare.
